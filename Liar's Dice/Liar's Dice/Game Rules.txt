Welcome to Liar's Dice!

In this game, each player will virtually roll five dice. Each 
player can only veiw their own dice, and rolling only happens once 
at the beginning of the game.

Once everyone has rolled, the game begins.

On a player's turn, the player must make a guess for how many dice
in total landed on a certain number. For example, the player could 
call out "three twos". (Even if the player does not have any reason 
to believe there are three twos.)

At this point another player can call the first a liar. The game
will end there, and everyone's dice are revealed. If the guessing 
player was wrong, they win. If not, the one who called liar wins.

Should the turn pass without anyone calling liar, the next player
will make a guess. The first number of the guess must be higher 
than the last player's. For example, after "three twos", the next
player cannot guess that there is less than four dice with a 
certain number on it.
